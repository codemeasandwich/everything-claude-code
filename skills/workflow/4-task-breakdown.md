# Phase 4: Task Breakdown

**Goal:** Create a detailed implementation roadmap with granular, actionable tasks.

After each step: update task tracking file in `todo/`

---

## 1. Generate Tasks & Sub-tasks

Rules:
- Break into granular, actionable tasks
- Each task completable in one focused session
- Include sub-tasks where needed
- Tasks should build progressively toward final solution

Format:
```markdown
## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1: [Name]**
  - [ ] Sub-task a
  - [ ] Sub-task b
- [ ] **Task 2: [Name]**
  - [ ] Sub-task a
```

## 2. Present Task List

- Show complete task breakdown to user
- **STOP and wait for explicit approval before coding**

---

## Phase Exit Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 5 (Implementation):
- [ ] Tasks broken into granular sub-tasks
- [ ] Task list approved by user
