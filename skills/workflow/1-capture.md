# Phase 1: Capture & Understand

**Goal:** Document the request and surface assumptions before defining scope.

After each step: update task tracking file in `todo/`

---

## 1. Log the Request

- Create task tracking markdown file in `todo/`
- Include user's original wording **verbatim**

## 2. Initial Clarification

Ask about:
- Intent — what problem are they actually trying to solve?
- Scope — how big/small should this be?
- Constraints — timeline, technical limitations, dependencies?

Surface all assumptions for confirmation.

---

## Phase Exit Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 2 (Requirements):
- [ ] Request logged verbatim
- [ ] Intent clarified
- [ ] Initial scope understood
- [ ] Constraints identified
- [ ] Assumptions surfaced and confirmed
