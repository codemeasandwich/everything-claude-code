# Phase 3: Architecture & High-Level Plan

**Goal:** Design the solution at a high level before breaking into tasks.

After each step: update task tracking file in `todo/`

---

## 1. Review Technical Constraints

Check before designing:
- [ ] Required packages based on project type:
  - JS/TS/Node/Web/SaaS → see `skills/stack_tech-stack-js.md`
  - Unity/Unreal/Godot/VR/AR/Games → see `skills/stack_tech-stack-vr-game.md`
- [ ] Testing philosophy (see `skills/workflow_testing-philosophy.md`)
- [ ] Existing project patterns and architecture
- [ ] Docker-only execution requirement (where applicable)

## 2. High-Level Design

Document:
- Components/modules involved
- Files to create/modify
- New dependencies or patterns being introduced
- Algorithm choices and alternative approaches considered

## 3. Present for Approval

- Write high-level plan to task tracking file
- Present to user for review
- **STOP and wait for explicit approval before proceeding**

---

## Phase Exit Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 4 (Task Breakdown):
- [ ] Technical constraints reviewed
- [ ] High-level design documented
- [ ] Architecture approved by user
